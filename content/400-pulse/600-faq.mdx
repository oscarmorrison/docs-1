## What databases are supported with Prisma Pulse?

Prisma Pulse currently supports PostgreSQL with plans to extend support to MySQL in the near future.

Prisma Pulse primarily interfaces with a database's write-ahead log (Postgres) or binlog (MySQL) to efficiently capture data change events, offering a more performant solution than regular polling through scheduled queries.

Note that Prisma Pulse may not work with every Postgres-compatible database, as compatibility depends on the exposure of Postgres-native logical replication capabilities required for Prisma Pulse to listen to database events.

<Admonition type="warning">

Prisma Pulse’s database compatibility list will be different from Prisma Client's database compatibility list. If you want to use Prisma Pulse with an existing application using Prisma ORM, please verify the database and hosting provider are supported.

## How does Prisma Pulse handle schema changes in the database?

Prisma Pulse is designed to work seamlessly with schema changes in your database by utilizing [Change data capture (CDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) techniques and combining that with the power of schema-driven data access using [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client). When your Prisma schema is updated, Pulse automatically adapts to the changes, ensuring that your real-time data synchronization remains consistent and reliable.

Prisma Pulse leverages the type information generated by Prisma ORM to create type-safe database subscriptions, allowing you to catch potential issues at compile time and maintain the integrity of your data throughout the development process. This approach allows Prisma Pulse to efficiently capture and propagate data changes while maintaining compatibility with evolving database structures.

## How can I increase the throughput for Prisma Pulse?

Throughput for Prisma Pulse will increase as the Database event size decreases and the number of concurrent listeners decreases.

While ensuring Database event size can be tricky, we recommend some best practices, such as:

- Avoid large fields in your model, such as storing base64 image strings in the database; Instead, consider storing them in popular file storage options such as AWS S3 or Cloudflare.

- Creating publication slots for specific models rather than all the models in the database. You can learn more about managing your replication slots [here](/pulse/getting-started#configuring-replication-slots).

- Upgrading to use modern versions of PostgreSQL due to performance optimizations.
  > ℹ️ Modern versions of PostgreSQL (`v15`+) allow you to create a publication slot for specific fields of a particular model.

## Does Prisma Pulse work in a serverless environment?

Currently, Prisma Pulse does not work in a serverless environment. Prisma Pulse works best when it is able to maintain a long-running active connection with your application. However, many serverless runtime providers limit the duration of serverless functions. We’re actively working on improving the experience in serverless applications.
